```

1. What is the spatial distribution of global, fishing, and land-based threats in the CA Current?

2. (for week 2 of the lab) Where were MPAs placed? Which threats do they address?


- Using geotiff data (.tif)
- Stores Metadata or attributes about the file as        embedded tif tags

```{r packages}

library(raster)       
#Main raster library with nearly all functions used in this analysis
library(rgdal)        
#Spatial library - most functions used from rgdal are for vectors (shapefiles)
library(rasterVis)    
#Useful for raster visualizations
library(maps)         
#Has a database of maps. I use this to add a map to my raster to visualize land boundaries
library(rgeos)        
#Need this library for topology operations on geometries
library(dplyr)        
#NOT spatial - this is a data wrangling library
library(RColorBrewer)
library(wesanderson)
```

```{r settings}

cols = rev(colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(11, 'Spectral'))(255))
par(mar=c(2,2,1,1)) 
```

```{r data}

all_threats <- raster("R:/Spring2018/ESM270/Week8_R_hotspots/Threats_data/full_modelnv.tif")

#pal <- wes_palette(6, name = "Zissou1", type = "continuous")

```

```{r}
plot(all_threats,ext=extent(-125,-117,32,35), col = cols, main = "Cumulative Threats")
map('world',fill=T,add=T,col="gray70")
zoom(all_threats, col=cols)
```
